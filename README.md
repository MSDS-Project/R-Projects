# R-Projects
Various projects completed using R and RStudio

These are examples of some small projects/programs using R and RStudio. This is a work in progress and additional files will be added over time.
<br><br><strong>The Current files are: </strong><br><br>
<strong>Predicting Abalone Ages</strong> - Predicting the age of an abalone in years of abalone shells (rings) using physical measurements 
such as length diameter, whole weight, etc. using the abalone data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone <br><br>
<strong>Mushroom Classifiers </strong>- Classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using SVM and ANN classifiers using data set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom
SVM experiments with different kernels (e.g. linear SVM, Gaussian kernel SVM, and polynomial kernel SVM) to determine which kernel 
is appropriate for this data set. ANN neural network experiments with different parameters (e.g. learning rate), and different network 
architecture (e.g. number of hidden nodes, activation function, hidden layer=1) to determine the best network architecture. <br><br>
<strong>Breast Cancer Classification</strong> - Uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original) 
and deep learning from H2o package to train and classify images as benign or malignant. Investigates the prediction performance 
on multiple runs using H2o package and experimenting by varying parameters such as numbers of layers, numbers of nodes, etc.,).<br><br>
